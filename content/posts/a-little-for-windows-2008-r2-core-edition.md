<h2><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">What is Core Edition? </span></h2><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">It should be made for various "basic roles" for windows, like DC and LDAP, File Server and Print Server, DHCP and DNS. It's can not run Microsoft SQL server, or Microsoft Exchange, as they are not basic roles.  However it's can run IIS and Hyper-V.</span><br /><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Cons for Core Edition</span></h2><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I don't mind it can't run MMC locally, but it can't run Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer, which makes it pretty difficult to use. For command line, it doesn't support powershell, which disappointed me again, however the later version of core server, for example 2012, changed it.<br />&nbsp;</span><br /><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">First steps to configure Core Edition</span></h2><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/configuring-windows-server-2008-networking-settings.htm">Configuring Windows Server 2008 Server Core Basic Networking Settings</a> has some basic command to help you get started. </span>
