I need to testing if I can create a big file somewhere, and need a small tool to quickly do it. Refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/982659/quickly-create-large-file-on-a-windows-system" target="_blank">this thread </a>. I end up chose <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/982659/quickly-create-large-file-on-a-windows-system" target="_blank">RDFC</a>, it works like a charm. Of course, other tools like fsutil works too, but there are some limitations, for example you have to be Administrator to use fstuil, and there is no data created on the hard drive, and I failed to create file on a network share.
