<br />IT Polices normally have media card encrypted. After remove IT policy from Blackberry, the media card encryption is still enabled. That's why you still have to use password.<br /><br />If user can't remember media card password,&nbsp; they can't disable it, then you can't remove your password. While this sounds disappointing, but reasonable, there is a way out.<br /><br />Shutdown, take the media card out, boot it. Now you can use the new password you putted in after wiped the BB to disable media encryption, in turn you can disable the password.
