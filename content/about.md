Welcome to my blog! I am an IT professional with a few decades of experience in the field.

## CLI, not GUI

I love CLI, as it is a valuable tool for IT professionals as it allows for efficient and precise execution of tasks, and can be used to automate processes and manage multiple systems at once.

## Scripting, not documentation

Why document while you can get it done with one script? If you don't have time to make a script, give me all your commands for me to copy/paste.

## Learn to program

Cloudformation, Terraform, Kubernetes, SAM, CDK, let me learn real programming.
