# Multiple Desktop Contact List on BB


&nbsp;Found these wonderful thread about this issue <a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/BlackBerry-Storm/Deleting-a-Contact-List/td-p/135236" target="_blank">here</a>. I just take the question and answer out for you to read easily. <br /><br />Q: Somehow when I starting syncing my new Storm, I ended up with 3 Desktop  Contact Lists - all the same, all with the title of "Desktop".&nbsp; Now when  I go to Contacts, I have 3 copies of every entry.&nbsp; Anyone know how I  can delete a contact list individually without resetting the unit ?  Thanks.                    <br />&nbsp;A: This is caused when someone moves or re-adds a BB user to the BES  without wiping their Blackberry before reactivating. This will create a  new contact list each time. To remove it, go to Contacts and click  Options. Then type rset, it will pop up with a screen asking if you want  to wipe the contacts, select yes through all windows. You can then  wirelessly sync or use desktop manager to repopulate contacts.<br /><br />Actually you don't have to delete all of them, answer yes to the confirmation questions that mentioned "It's not Sync wirelessly",&nbsp; that will get rid of the duplicated ones.
