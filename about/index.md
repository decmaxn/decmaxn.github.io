# About


Welcome to my blog! I am an IT professional with a few decades of experience in the field and tons of thing to learn.

## CLI, not GUI

I love CLI, as it is a valuable tool for IT professionals as it allows for efficient and precise execution of tasks, plus small text documentation without screen shots.  

## Scripting, not documentation
Put commands together and copy/paste can be used to automate processes and manage multiple systems at once. Scripting to stack tasks to make large systems and problems manageable like [My MDT system](https://github.com/decmaxn/MDTlab.git) 
## DevOps

Create infrastructure with Cloudformation, Terraform, Kubernetes, SAM.
[Git](/git) should be the single system of truth for both code and infr, even documents.

## Programing

Let me deal with error and logic with real programing, eventually everything is code. [Python](/python) here I am.
