# Thank you, Cloud.

Started to learn go, I feel that I have to review my Kubernetes (K8s) skills. Cloned my old K8s Lab repo, starting up the lab environment using VirtualBox and Vagrant, I thought it would be like riding a bike.

However, things didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. I spent hours struggling to make things work with current versions of everything, which is expected. After that the same laptop doesn't work as good as before, encountering errors left and right, waiting there for CPU to come down to normal, worrying that my old laptop might be too dirty, that the high temperature is slowing down it mor and feeling completely out of my depth.

As I sat there, exhausted and relieved, I realized that I had taken cloud computing for granted. With the cloud, for years I never had to worry about setting up my own environment, or dealing with the headaches of local development. Everything just worked, seamlessly and effortlessly.

Now I took out my dusty desktops, decided to build a bare metal K8s cluster. With all the time I spent on this virtual lab, why not build a proper physical lab :-)
