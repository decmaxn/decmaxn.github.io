# Will emails deleted from BB been deleted from Outlook, and vise versa?


Been a Black Berry user for years, I have never paid attention to this question.Well the answer is yes, but if you do a test, you probably won't have time to wait for it happen. Emails on BB and your Outlook will sync over air, but not immediately.<br /><br />"Reconcile Now" will sync two place immediately. So do emails youâ€™ve read on your Black Berry appear read in your Outlook.
