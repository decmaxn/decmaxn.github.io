You might get this idea that you need to install Goggle Authenticator APP on your phone,and found that there is no native app available in your Blackberry world or Amazon App Store. However you get around it by sideload android apps. How to use Google two-step authentication on Blackberry 10 ask you to install Gauth. I installed it and then got rid of it, because I found that an application specific password need to be generated for iPhone, Android and of course my Blackberry. Well, I don’t think that’s 2 factor authentication anymore, but that’s officially suggested by Google, I must at least try it. When I did this I found no where to put in this new password - There is no box for you to put it in on my Blackberry！How come there is there is on in Z10 as indicated in BlackBerry Z10, Gmail and 2-Step Authentication? In this post, I found someone also doesn’t have this way to put in password, but it prompts, mine doesn’t! What makes me more worried is I still have access to my emails, calendar and contacts, even I can’t access them from my computer with only my password. Do I really have to delete my Google account from Blackberry and add it back? What if someone try to get my email by steal my phone? It seems I won’t be able stop them by change my gmail password! Why it can still access my gmails, contacts and calendar? because it’s trusted by google for a period of time, I don’t know how long - maybe as long as 30 days. Well, if you do lost your phone, there is a way to make it expire immediately, as shown here by AnimalPak200. Later on I also found Workaround 1 in KB34651，and I did that too. It’s turned out application specific password is not 2 factor authentication, it’s just a walk around on devices can not use 2 factor authentication. For your Z30, you don’t have to use it, as this new phone is able to use 2 factor authentication, just like your computer! Shortly after you made it expire, there will be error messages for email, calendar or contacts, but there is still no prompt for password. At this point, be patient, eventually it will prompt for user name and password. When it prompts, don’t use the application specific password, use the real one. Remember, your Z30 is treated as a computer by Google right now. After password, you need a SMS code, just like on a new computer. After that, you are all set. So, just treat your Z30 as a computer, ignore all other posts online.

Refer to this KB.  Root cause is the Email address length. About Email Address length, I found this online, and there seems to have different standards. “There appears to be some confusion over the maximum valid email address size. Most people believe it to be 320 characters (64 characters for the username + 255 characters for the domain + 1 character for the @ symbol). Other sources suggest 129 (64 + 1 + 64) or 384 (128+1+255, assuming the username doubles in length in the future.” Trend Micro support claim they follow an RFC standard limited to 64 characters before the @ symbol. After my user change her email address, the sender address is longer than 64 characters now. Solution:Trend Micro has released a hot fix to disable this checking for version 7.0, and support has confirmed only an extra line in an ini file is needed for version 7.1.

But it’s strange that I have never get into a duplicated SID problem by cloning my existing windows VMs and put them into one windows network. I have even developed a list of templates VMs for most of the Windows OS. All I need to do when I need to new machine is to clone the template, they are all from the same a few templates.  For example, Psgetsid shows that all the XP VMs have the same SID, however they are in the same network, and have never give me any problem.             S-1-5-21-725345543-1682526488-1957994488       XP51 CloneS-1-5-21-725345543-1682526488-1957994488       XP51Anyway, recently I run into this problem with cloning a Windows 2003 Server R2 VM. There is no problem to join the domain till I try to login to the domain. Here is the error message. The problem is due to this Windows and AD controller are both clone from the same Windows I created as a template, so they have the same SID. To solve this problem, I used Microsoft’s SysPrep tool, and created a new template, then cloned this template to build a new VM. The problem still exist. I did 2 tests, just made sure I did follow my instruction no wrong.  Obviously the sysprep wasn’t success.To prove it, I found psgetsid.exe tool shows that these 2 boxes from same syspreped image, and the AD controller is also from the same image before sysprep.  S-1-5-21-1623163922-654890622-3203205963       Both system cloned from the syspreped image have the same SIDS-1-5-21-1623163922-654890622-3203205963       Even the AD controller cloned from the image before Sysprep have the same SID.

By default, VirtualBox's NAT engine will route TCP/IP packets through the default interface assigned by the host's TCP/IP stack. (The technical reason for this is that the NAT engine uses sockets for communication.) If, for some reason, you want to change this behavior, you can tell the NAT engine to bind to a particular IP address instead.

Q: Somehow when I starting syncing my new Storm, I ended up with 3 Desktop Contact Lists - all the same, all with the title of “Desktop”. Now when I go to Contacts, I have 3 copies of every entry. Anyone know how I can delete a contact list individually without resetting the unit ? Thanks. A: This is caused when someone moves or re-adds a BB user to the BES without wiping their Blackberry before reactivating. This will create a new contact list each time. To remove it, go to Contacts and click Options. Then type rset, it will pop up with a screen asking if you want to wipe the contacts, select yes through all windows. You can then wirelessly sync or use desktop manager to repopulate contacts. Actually you don’t have to delete all of them, answer yes to the confirmation questions that mentioned “It’s not Sync wirelessly”, that will get rid of the duplicated ones.

APC’s product manual is not perfect, which include some out dated information, plus it's easy to over look the simple HyperTerminal program, I have had some hard time with them. Here are what I learned. There are 4 ways to assign IP address according to APC’s product manual.  I was interested by the ARP way, it looks efficient, but it didn’t work for me with unknown reason. Also I didn’t know where to find the MAC address at beginning, it’s turned out on a supermarket receipt kind of paper taped on the product. Next, I installed the Device IP Configuration Wizard program from a CD come with the product, and started it. I made another mistake by immediately clicked next, and jumped to the next page, and start to be confused.  I should have read on the first page and waited for the device to be picked up. It worked for me later on.    Next, because I wondered how am I find out what IP address is been assigned to, I choosed connct through Serial Port. Later on I realized IP address should be get from DHCP server, because Vendor Class / Client/User Class Identifiers will be sent to DHCP server, and shows up there. With Serial Port, I end up calling APC support, here are mistakes I made. Hyper Terminal is decommissioned on Windows 7, but simply copy hypertrm.exe and hypertrm.dll from a XP box works like a charm. Special Serial Cable should be used, they are come with the product and labeled on the connector. Follow the user manual to make sure you have the right cable. I had a hard time to connect to my ATS even with the correct cable. It’s end up I didn’t pay attention to the port configuration. They are 19200 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow control. Note, HyperTerminal come with Hardward Flow control as default. It has to be changed. Sometimes 9600 bps works too, but there is one time I spend a long time to troubleshoot, and it’s end up 19200 bps solved the problem. To configure IP address, you have to use option 11, Web config. They renamed it to something like NMW config, but it’s still option 11.  You will have to login as apc/apc to see option 11, if you just press enter twice to get in, there is another menu without option 11. Once you chosed option 11, you no longer can connect with 19200 bps, it has to be 2400 bps. One way to get it back is to reset by push down perf button on ATS for 10 seconds, till the light off. Just read the instruction once chose option 11.  Note this reset won’t change configurations already made, also I don’t know what difference of this with the reset pin button on the front panel of the network management card.

What is an IT Policy and how can I view it?My first mistake is, I thought \"Reset to factory default\" is more cleaner, but it’s not. My understanding is they are different thing. Here is statement from BlackBerry official tech support. The factory reset performs much like the Wipe Handheld option from the BlackBerry smartphone, with some minor differences. Wipe Handheld - The Wipe Handheld option is performed directly on the BlackBerry smartphone (see KB02318 and KB14058). This option removes all BlackBerry application data (emails, address book entries, calendar events, etc.), and allows the deletion of User Installed Applications and the content of the Media Card.Reset to Factory Defaults - Application data will be removed and so are IT Policies. Third-party programs will  NOT be affected by this operation. They will remain intact. My second mistake. Everybody knows this, the most of important thing here is to back up first. Since my BB has a big built-in memory, I don’t really have a media card, all my media files are saved there. I thought my Giga-bytes of media files will be bypassed, so my backup didn’t include build-in media card, that’s a big mistake. The wipe Handheld process deleted all of them, it affected my background picture, and ringtone. Restore will bring the list back, but not the actual files. The names are dimmed. BES Activation won’t bring previous emails you received back, it will make you receive new emails. Old emails still have to be restore from your backup.

I have added a little bit myself. IEESC (IE Enhanced Security Mode) is a very good feature on most servers – you shouldn’t be doing much web surfing from your server’s desktop anyway and this helps protect you from malware, which is the last thing you want on a Windows Server system. Of course if Microsoft had any guts IE would be disabled by default, but I digress. Is it on or off? The obvious way is to start IE, and your home page is set to res://shdoclc.dll/hardAdmin.htm, which shows you it’s enabled. This is not accurate because I can manually set my home page to this address, and it will shows it’s Enabled, even it’s NOT. As shown in the following picture. Turning off IE ESC Manually On Windows 2003 Server it was easy – just open up Add/Remove Programs and remove the component from the server – IE becomes fully opened up. Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 had a nice easy way to do this as well. Just load up Server Manager (you know, that annoying screen that pops up every time you log in… okay, its in Administrative Tools if you have never used a computer before). Use servermanager.msc command to bring it up if you don’t have it opened. About a third down, see the Configure IE ESC link. Click it and you should see this box – by default a XenApp 6 server will have IE ESC turned off the users (cleverly) but on for administrators (annoyingly, especially if you are an administrator and you actually use Citrix). Configure as you see fit – personally its Off for both for me on all Citrix servers.

You need to close down any processes that end in capture.exe by pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL on your keyboard, then Task Manager \u003e Processes. If you want to check what processes are running, follow the steps below: 1. Open command prompt with admin rights. That is, type in cmd either in Start menu search box and hit Ctrl + Shift +Enter. 2. Click continue if you get the User Account Control (UAC) Prompt. 3. Here, first type the command tasklist and hit enter to see the list of running processes. 4. If you can see the running processes then type another command tasklist\u003ec:\\list.txt which gives you the output as list.txt file in \"c\" drive. Note that you can change the drive letter \"c\" and also the output file name (list.txt). 5. Type exit and go back to your \"C\" drive were your copy is available.  You can also Type tasklist/svc\u003ec:\\processlist.txt to also get a list of services running.
